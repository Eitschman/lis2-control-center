# Windows + Linux shared Avalonia port — implementation status

Date: 2026-10-13
Branch: `feature/linux-avalonia`
Status: **Shared Avalonia shell with selectable navigation committed; compilation and runtime not yet verified**

## Target architecture
- ONE Avalonia UI and application runtime for Windows x64 and Linux x64/ARM64.
- Windows-only providers (Winamp, GSMTC, native plugins) and Linux-only providers (MPRIS, Linux sensors) are selected behind common interfaces.
- The WPF app remains an interim regression baseline, not a permanent separate Windows product.
- Both Windows and Linux builds, UI behavior, packaging and hardware safety must be validated before WPF retirement.

## Implemented
- Retargeted `LIS2.Core`, `LIS2.Display`, `LIS2.Fans` to `net8.0`, overriding the inherited Windows-only framework. Existing Windows WPF app remains unchanged.
- Retargeted their three xUnit test projects to `net8.0`.
- Added `.github/workflows/linux-portable.yml` to run these test projects on Ubuntu on branch pushes and PRs.

- Added `src/LIS2.App.Avalonia` with `net8.0`, Avalonia 11.3.6 references, `Program`, `App`, and a static main window displaying ten navigation labels. This is a nonfunctional UI shell, not a port of the existing WPF workflows.
- Expanded GitHub Actions matrix to Windows and Ubuntu for both portable unit tests and Avalonia shell compilation.

- Made all ten sidebar sections selectable in the shared Avalonia shell; selection updates the section heading and explicitly labels unavailable functionality. This is not feature parity.

## Verification and limitations
- Static scan of the three library trees found no direct WPF, WinForms, Registry, WinRT, or P/Invoke usage.
- The `System.IO.Ports` dependency remains and actual serial device behavior on Linux is **not** verified.
- No .NET SDK is installed in the current execution environment; local `dotnet build` / `dotnet test` could not be run.
- GitHub commit status query returned no reported statuses and the PR-run endpoint returned no runs for the previous commit. This does NOT prove either success or failure. A local container execution attempt failed with an infrastructure ClientError; therefore no actual compile/test was performed. Do not mark Windows or Linux tests green until Actions succeeds.
- Avalonia package references and a static UI shell have been added, but package restore, Windows/Linux compilation and GUI startup have not yet been confirmed.
- The Windows release workflow and WPF source files have not been modified.

## Next work
1. Confirm Ubuntu workflow success and Windows solution CI.
2. Introduce platform-neutral application runtime with tests while preserving WPF behavior.
3. Confirm the shared Avalonia shell builds and launches on Windows and Linux; then add shared view models and a virtual LIS2 smoke test.
4. Implement Windows and Linux providers, then UI feature parity and physical-device safety validation on both systems.

## Pull request gate
Open a PR against `main` only when a coherent, tested slice is ready. Keep this branch isolated until then.
